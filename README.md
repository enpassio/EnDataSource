# EnDataSource
Standard source/sample data set used for various projects/repositories of Enpassio. There can be different datasets from various sources and hence, source attributions should be done accordingly.

### Source of news data with both hardcoded values and respective link for accessing the same data
For projects requiring some data with texts as well as image url, we'd be referring to Newsapi.org api. And the sample hardcoded data used in various projects will be: https://gist.github.com/rajtheinnovator/a45ac7e2c1ec92c4aabc72891fbf84cf

The same data as above can also be retrieved using a GET request on Newsapi.org api using the link: https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=bbc-news&apiKey=your-newsapidotorg-api-key
